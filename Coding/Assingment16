Question: Create two tasks each capable of sending a message to Console at a fixed interval. Assume Task1 sends the message "Task 1 Trigger" at an interval of 20 ns while Task2 sends the message "Task 2 Trigger" at an interval of 40 ns. Keep the count of the number of times Task 1 and Task 2 trigger by adding a variable for keeping the track of task execution and incrementing with each trigger. Execute both tasks in parallel till 200 nsec. Display the number of times Task 1 and Task 2 executed after 200 ns before calling $finish for stopping the simulation.


module tb;

  int i=0;

  int j=0;

  task task1;

    forever begin

     #20;

    i++;

      $display("Task1 triggered and count is:",i);

    end
   

  endtask

 
  task task2;

    forever begin

     #40;

    j++;

    $display("Task2 triggered and count is:",j);

    end
  endtask


  initial begin

  fork

    task1();

    task2();

  join_none
        
          #200;

          $display("Task1 triggered and final count is:",i);

          $display("Task2 triggered and final count is:",j);

          $finish;
          end

endmodule
