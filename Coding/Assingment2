Question: Create an array capable of storing 10 elements of an unsigned integer. Initialize all the 10 elements to a value equal to the square of the index of that element. for e.g. first element has index no. 0 so initialize it to 0, the second element has index no. 1 so initialize it to 1, the third element has index no. 2 so initialize it to 4, and so on. Verify the code by sending values of all the elements on Console.

module tb;

 

  int arr[9:0]='{0,1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81};

 

  initial begin


    $display("arr: %0p",arr);

   

  end

endmodule
