module tb ();



class foo;

 

  int a,b,c;

 

  function new(input int a, input int b, input int c);

    this.a = a;

    this.b = b;

    this.c = c;

   

  endfunction

 

  endclass



 

  foo handler;

 

  initial begin

    handler = new(2,4,56);

    $display("the value of a is : %0d",handler.a);

    $display("the value of b is : %0d",handler.b);

    $display("the value of c is : %0d",handler.c);





   

  end
