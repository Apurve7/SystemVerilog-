Question: Assume class consists of three data members a, b, and c each of size 4-bit. Create a task inside the class that returns the result of the addition of data members. The task must also be capable of sending the value of a, b, c, and result to the console. Verify code for a = 1, b = 2, and c = 4.



class sample;



   bit [3:0]a,b,c;



   function new(input bit[3:0]x,y,z);

       a = x;

       b = y;

       c = z;

   endfunction



   task  add_and_display();

       bit [4:0]result;

        result = a + b + c;

        $display("a : %0d + b : %0d + c : %0d = result : %0d",a,b,c,result);

   endtask



endclass



module test;

    sample s;

    initial begin

        s = new(1,2,4);

        s.add_and_display();

    end

endmodule
