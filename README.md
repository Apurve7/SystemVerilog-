# SystemVerilog – Verification Series Part 1: SystemVerilog Essentials
All mentioned questions are solved with full honesty having my time and efforts pput into them


This repository contains the solutions to assignments from the **Verification Series Part 1: SystemVerilog Essentials** course.  
The repository focuses on understanding the theoretical and practical aspects of **SystemVerilog**, which is widely used in hardware design and verification.

SystemVerilog extends Verilog by adding advanced features like object-oriented programming, constrained randomization, and assertions, which are essential in modern verification environments.  
Through these assignments, the goal is to build a strong foundation in both design and verification concepts.

The course covers:
- Basics of SystemVerilog syntax and structure  
- Data types, operators, and procedural blocks  
- Tasks, functions, and modular design concepts  
- Object-oriented features such as classes and inheritance  
- Randomization, constraints, and functional coverage  
- Testbench development and simulation flow

These exercises strengthen the understanding of how hardware systems are modeled and verified efficiently using SystemVerilog.  
Each solution reflects the practical application of theoretical concepts learned throughout the course.
